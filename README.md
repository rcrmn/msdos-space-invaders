MS-DOS Space Invaders
=====================

Space Invaders version for MS-DOS, 3 levels with multiplayer option and a hidden level.


This is the first project we did in the degree. The code is shitty and all in one single file, as
we were required to hand it like this. Maybe I'll refactor it in the future.

Compile with Visual Studio and execute. Secret level is level ```1337```.

I tried porting it to the unix terminal years ago but didn't work very well. If anyone cares to try,
contact me.

I'll maybe also add a compiled code for the thing.
